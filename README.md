<h2>About</h2>
<p style='font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;'>
  This is my foundation for all my PHP web projects. I use REST & OOP principles.
  Including some common JS and SCSS files too. Filled with PHPDoc & JSDoc.
  There's two branches one with comments and then the main branch without comments.
  This README file also serves as a template for my other projects.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p style='font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;'>
  When I start a new PHP project, I copy these files which gives the project a nice
  structure and efficiency when starting a new project. Then I'll usually install sass and
  start it up. Then I can easily start working on the project with a clean and
  familiar structure that I enjoy using.
